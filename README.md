# Bias-Aware-Error-Compensation-Framework

This repository is used to generate all the files used in our research work on Microprocessors and Microsystems (Special Issue). I have provided a) Verilog codes of all the relevant designs b) Values directly taken from the designs whose verilog codes were not available because those designs were implemented in 45nm technology. c) tcl files used in the design is also given d) python codes used to find output Error Metrics. e) Test bench is also present
